# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This is an analysis of Kickstarter campaigns with a particular focus on theater projects in the United States and Great Britain. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends that may suggest successful campaign strategies that a playwrite can employ in her future Kickstarter campaigns aimed at funding two plays, one in the United States and one in Great Britain, each with different anticipated budgets.
## Outcomes Based on Variables
The data suggests that a campaign's success may be affected by the type of campaign, date of the campaign launch, the size of the budget, and the location of the project.
### Outcomes Based on Type of Project
![Parent](C:/Users/amnic/Desktop/Berkeley/1Crowdfunding/ParentCategoryOutcomes.png)
This data shows the volume of campaigns in each parent category, and the volume of each campaign outcome within those categories. Theater projects have one of the highest volumes of successful campaigns, based on this data.
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![LaunchDateAll](C:/Users/amnic/Desktop/Berkeley/1Crowdfunding/OutcomesBasedonLaunchDate_All.png)
This graph represents the rate of each campaign outcome based on the launch date for all campaign types.
![LaunchDateTheater](C:/Users/amnic/Desktop/Berkeley/1Crowdfunding/OutcomesBasedonLaunchDate_Theater.png)
This graph represents the rate of each campaign outcome based on the launch date for only theater campaigns.
Both graphs show that the highest volume of successful campaigns were launched in May, while the lowest volume of successful campaigns were launched in December. One possible reason for these shifts over time could be due to the overall volume of campaigns increasing, so the time of year could affect the overall volume of campaigns but not necessarily the success rate. One way to evaluate if the time of year is affecting the success rate instead of the overall volume of campaigns would be to analyze how the failure rate changes with the success rate. If they change in the same direction at the same rate, then the time of year is more likely affecting the volume of campaigns.
To determine that the success rate in May truly is higher than other months, we can compare it to another month with a similar failure rate: October. May's success rate is significantly higher then October's, even though their failure rate is the same, suggesting that May's success rate is due to the time of year rather than the volume of campaigns. We can determine that December's success rate is due to the time of year because while the success volume decreases, the failure volume increases.
Conclusion: Campaigns are most likely to succeed if launched in May, and least likely to succeed if launched in December.
